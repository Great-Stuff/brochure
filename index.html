                        <h2>What is it</h2>
                        <p>The legislative branch is one of the three branches of the federal government in the United States. It is responsible
                            for creating laws. The other two branches are the executive branch and the judicial branch. The legislative branch
                            consists of Congress and the fifty state legislatures Congress is made up of two houses: the House of
                            Representatives and the Senate. The House of Representatives has 435 members who are elected every two years. The
                            number of representatives each state has is based on its population. The Senate has 100 members, two from each
                            state, who are elected for six-year terms</p>
                    </div>

                        <h2>House of Representatives</h2>
                        <p>The United States House of Representatives is the lower chamber of the United States Congress. It is one of the two
                            houses of the bicameral legislature of the United States, with the Senate being the upper chamber. The House is
                            composed of representatives who sit in single-member congressional districts allocated to each state on the basis of
                            population as measured by the United States Census, with each district having one representative, provided that each
                            state is entitled to at least one</p>

                    <h2>What is it</h2>
                    <p>Article III of the United States Constitution establishes the Judicial Branch, with members appointed by the
                        President and confirmed by the Senate. Congress determines the structure and organization of the federal courts,
                        including the number of Supreme Court justices. Only the House of Representatives and the Senate can impeach and
                        convict federal judges. Judges and Justices serve until they pass away, resign, or are found guilty by the Senate.
                        The authority of the federal courts is defined by Congress, and they hear genuine disputes at the district,
                        appellate, and Supreme Court levels.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>The Supreme Court</h2>
                    <p>The Supreme Court of the United States is the highest court mandated by the Constitution. Its Justices, determined by
                        Congress, hold lifelong terms after nomination and Senate approval. While primarily handling appeals, its decisions
                        are final. The Court focuses on interpreting laws and providing guidance rather than conducting trials. It plays a
                        crucial role as the ultimate legal authority in federal law matters.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Judicial Process</h2>
                    <p>The United States Constitution guarantees the right to a fair trial for those accused of wrongdoing, with additional
                        protections provided by amendments. Criminal and civil cases follow a process involving arrest, charges, evidence
                        review, trial, and potential appeals. Appellate courts review legal errors, while the U.S. Supreme Court may hear
                        cases of significant legal principles or conflicting interpretations. The legal system ensures fairness, protection
                        of rights, and resolution of disputes at various court levels.</p>
